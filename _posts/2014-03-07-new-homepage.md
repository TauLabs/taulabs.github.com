We updated the home page to a new system. It uses a great package called [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) that makes it really easy to add posts and updates and generate static pages. Github has great native support for this. The style utilizes [Pure](http://purecss.io/).

If you want to push modifications or new updates you can fork the home page like anything else on [github](https://github.com/TauLabs/taulabs.github.com). Feedback is welcome!
