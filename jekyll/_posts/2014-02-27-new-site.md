Today we are rolling out a new forum page for our community. Since Tau Labs was established we have been growing a large number of new members and the google groups is not meeting all of their needs. We will be launching some phpBB forums where you can all exchange ideas and help each other out. The url forums.taulabs.org will be directed this weekend and you will see it once the DNS changes propagate.

We hope this everyone will find this useful.
